Duplicated sequence detection using sequenceSniffer shiny app developed by Anne Rutten (https://github.com/alrutten/sequenceSniffer).

Each folder contains:
- the raw data file (transformed into wide or long format when judged useful)
- Pdf report of highlighting sequence duplications and randomization tests
- Excel file highlighting duplicated sequences exported from the sequenceSniffer app (not done when tests indicates duplications are not more likely than randomized samples)

Summary of findings:
- 3 out of 6 columns in the Mesocosm dataset have > 30 % duplications 
-  6 out of 8 columns in the Pardosa mesocosm activity dataset with 49 % or more duplicated values
- 2 rows > 66 % duplicated when transforming the Pardosa mesocosm activity dataset into wide format
- No duplication rows found in the Pardosa repeatability dataset
- Some duplications found in the cannibalism dataset, but likely due to low range of data 
- Some duplications found in the single predator-single prey dataset, but most likely due to low range of data for activity and binary data for capture
